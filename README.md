# Netflix Adblock

Netflix does not understand art.  Netflix plays ads during the closing credits of its own films.  This Firefox browser extension might prevent Netflix from ruining art.

Install the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/netflix-adblock/).

## FAQ

### I work for Netflix.  Our official policy is that our content does not contain ads.

Trailers for platform-locked media are actually just ads.

### I work for Google.  How do I collect your personal data?

The code contained by this repository is cross-platform, and probably also works in Chrome.

### If the credits are included at the end of the film, but ads play instead, were the credits ever really included at all?

No.
